“Mike; I found your recent article interesting as well as the information shared on your LinkedIn page. I have just begun a search for my next role and am interested in the differences a retained search offers. Please accept my connection request.”

“My name is XXXXX & I hope it’s ok I reached out. I read your post about not ignoring recruiters. It was valuable and made me wonder what you do. I checked out Find My Profession. Looks solid. I’m looking for a change and wonder if FMP is hiring new ‘recruiters’ in LA?”

“Hi, Mike! I appreciate your mindset when it comes to placing people in the right setting, so I would love to connect. I may not need your guidance at this time, but I hope to spark the connection now, for when the time comes in the future. Take care and I wish you the best!”

“I saw your posting and your tagline [Definitely not a recruiter] GOT my attention. It would be so refreshing to have representation from someone that understands what I do and my abilities based upon my discipline rather than [throw at the wall and see what sticks].”

“Hello Mike, your post was very insightful and I love the title of your LinkedIn profile. I may not be a client anytime soon, but who knows in the future. Would love to connect if that works for you. Either way, have a lovely day!”

“Hi Mike, It’s very nice meeting you virtually. One of our mutual contacts liked your latest post, I thought the tips were very practical and yet profound. I would love to connect with you and continue to learn more about your role and expertise in the business.” 


Hi Sachin,
Hope you are doing well.
I’ve just seen that you work with PwC. I'm a Software Engineer & I’ve been curious about the work at The Big4. If you would like then I’d love to chat and know more about the firm and its growth prospects.
Thanks in advance,
Shantanu
